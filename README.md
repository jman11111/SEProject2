# SEProject2

We built a frontend and backend to support the searching of similar tweets to the one put in to the front end

## Getting Started

Not sure of this yet


## Functionality

GUI: Sophie working in react to make a webapp like frontend, unknown if it will be a web app or not, or just local hosting.

Twitter Search API: Jean luc getting tokens, working in node to help

Weather API: Jack Naworski getting Weather data when fed a location

Design Pattern: Observer, to check for when requests are received from frontend, so corresponding data can be sent from backend. Jack Broncato is to do backend in node and have the two APIâ€™s interact with it.
