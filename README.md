# SEProject2

We built a React.js application along with a Node.js backend server to provide the react frontend with data. 


## Functionality

GUI: Sophie (The Savior) working in react to make a locally hosted webapp like frontend 

Twitter Search API: Jack Broncato and Jean-Luc provided twitter backend API calls for the frontend

Design Pattern: Observer, the server observes for requests and responds when they are recieved. (Jack B.)
